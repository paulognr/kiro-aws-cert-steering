# Kiro AWS Certification Steering Documents

A collection of steering documents that transform [Kiro CLI](https://kiro.dev/cli/) into a personalized AWS certification exam tutor.

## What Are Steering Documents?

Steering documents are instruction sets that guide Kiro CLI on how to conduct interactive practice sessions for specific AWS certifications. Each document includes:

- **Exam structure** - Official domains, weightings, and question format
- **Question methodology** - How to present questions in exam style
- **Answer evaluation** - Detailed feedback and explanation approach
- **Performance tracking** - Domain-by-domain progress monitoring
- **Adaptive learning** - Focus on weak areas and reinforce concepts
- **Study patterns** - Common traps, key topics, and exam strategies

## How to Use

1. **Choose your certification** - Select the steering document for your target exam
2. **Start Kiro CLI** - Run `kiro-cli chat` in your terminal
3. **Load the steering document** - Paste the content or reference the file
4. **Begin practice** - Say "ready" or "let's practice" to start your session

Kiro will present exam-style questions, wait for your answers, provide detailed feedback, track your performance by domain, and adapt to focus on your weak areas.
